# USB Thermal Printer Setup for Fulcitt POS AppImage

This document explains how to configure USB thermal printer access when running Fulcitt POS as an AppImage on Linux systems.

## Overview

Fulcitt POS uses ESC/POS thermal printers via USB. AppImages run in a sandboxed environment but can access system USB devices with proper permissions.

## Prerequisites

- USB thermal printer (ESC/POS compatible)
- Linux system with USB support
- Administrative access for initial setup

## USB Device Permission Setup

### 1. Identify Your Printer

Connect your thermal printer and identify its USB vendor and product IDs:

```bash
# List USB devices to find your printer
lsusb

# Look for your printer in the output, e.g.:
# Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0416:5011 Winbond Electronics Corp. Virtual Com Port
#                      ^^^^:^^^^
#                      VID :PID
```

### 2. Create udev Rules

Create a udev rule to allow access to your specific printer:

```bash
# Create udev rule file (replace VID:PID with your printer's values)
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-thermal-printer.rules
```

Add this content (replace `0416` and `5011` with your printer's VID and PID):

```
# Thermal printer udev rule
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0416", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5011", MODE="0666", GROUP="lp", TAG+="uaccess"
```

### 3. Add User to LP Group

```bash
# Add your user to the lp (line printer) group
sudo usermod -a -G lp $USER

# Verify group membership
groups $USER
```

### 4. Reload udev Rules

```bash
# Reload udev rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

# Unplug and reconnect your printer
```

### 5. Verify Permissions

```bash
# Check printer device permissions
ls -l /dev/usb/lp*

# Should show something like:
# crw-rw-rw- 1 root lp 180, 0 Dec 12 10:30 /dev/usb/lp0
```

## Alternative: Generic USB Printer Rule

If you want to allow access to all USB printers (less secure but more convenient):

```bash
# Generic rule for all USB printers
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{bInterfaceClass}=="07", MODE="0666", GROUP="lp", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-printers.rules
```

## Testing Printer Access

### 1. Test with Raw Commands

```bash
# Test basic connectivity (replace with your device)
echo -e "\x1B\x40Hello World\x0A\x1D\x56\x41\x10" > /dev/usb/lp0
```

### 2. Test in Fulcitt POS

1. Launch the AppImage
2. Go to Settings â†’ Printer Configuration
3. Click "Scan USB Devices"
4. Select your printer from the list
5. Use "Test Print" to verify functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors

If you see "Permission denied" when accessing the printer:

1. Verify the user is in the `lp` group: `groups $USER`
2. Log out and log back in (group changes require session restart)
3. Check udev rule syntax: `sudo udevadm test /sys/bus/usb/devices/[device]`
4. Verify device path: `ls -l /dev/usb/lp*`

### Device Not Found

If the printer isn't detected:

1. Check USB connection: `lsusb`
2. Verify kernel modules: `lsmod | grep usblp`
3. Check dmesg for USB events: `dmesg | tail -20`

### CUPS Conflicts

If CUPS has claimed the printer:

1. Stop CUPS temporarily: `sudo systemctl stop cups`
2. Test Fulcitt POS
3. Restart CUPS: `sudo systemctl start cups`

## Security Considerations

The udev rules above grant broad access to USB printers. For production environments:

1. Use specific VID:PID combinations rather than generic rules
2. Consider creating a dedicated user group for POS operations
3. Restrict physical access to USB ports
4. Regularly audit USB device access logs

## AppImage-Specific Notes

- AppImages can access system USB devices through `/dev/usb/` paths
- No additional sandboxing bypass is required for USB printer access
- The escpos and rusb libraries are bundled within the AppImage
- Network printers would require additional firewall configuration

## Support

For printer-specific issues:
1. Check manufacturer documentation for ESC/POS compatibility
2. Test with other ESC/POS software to isolate hardware issues
3. Verify thermal paper specifications match printer requirements

For Fulcitt POS issues:
1. Check application logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify printer configuration in application settings
3. Test with different USB ports or cables
